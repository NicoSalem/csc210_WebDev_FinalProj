# Project Proposal

*Ashely Tenesaca, Kevin Kao, Nicholas Salem, Salih Zainulabdeen* 



### Project Idea 

We plan to create a tool that enables users to compare products from big retail stores such as Wegmans and Walmart. The tool enables the user to search for terms such `Toothpaste`, then the tool would connect to Wegmans and Walmart APIs, get all the results of `Toothpaste` and display the results for the user with prices and details. As result, the use can compare products from Walmart and Wegmans in a single search operation. Moreover, we plan to enable to the user to create their own shopping lists. For example, the user would love to plan what to purchase from Walmart and what to purchase from Wegmans, we enable the user to add products to her/his shopping list and save the list to our database. 

Please note that our service is not limited to Wegmans and Walmart. They are the retail stores that we quickly thought of as we know for sure that both of them have APIs. We will investigate other retail stores as well. 



### Features 

As a start, we plan to add the features below to our service. If time permits, we will add more features 

- `Search:` Enable the user to search for a certain product and get a list of result from Walmart, Wegmans, .. and possible more retail stores. 
- `Compare:` Enable the user to compare the products from different retail stores 
- `View lists:` Enable the user to view shopping lists that were created by others 
- `Create shopping list:` Enable the user to create their own shopping lists and add products to their lists. 
- `Select Stores to Compare:` Enable the user to filter the results by selecting only the stores that they would like to compare. For example, if the user searches for `toothpaste` and gets results from Walmart, Wegmans, Costco, and Walgreens, and the user wants to compare `toothpaste` from Walmart and Wegmans only, they can apply search filters that enable them to do that.
